<b>Kale and White-Bean Stew</b></br>
</br>
Combining Two Portuguese favorites—kale-and-sausage soup and a bean, sausage, and tomato stew—makes a simple, sensational one-pot meal. To keep the focus on the vegetables, we've used just a tiny amount of fresh sausage; you can add more, if you like, or substitute dried chorizo or pepperoni.
</br>
<b>Ingredients<b></br>
</br>
2 tablespoons cooking oil</br>
1/4 pound mild or hot sausages, casings removed</br>
//I use Andouille sausage and it's soooo good!!
2 onions, chopped</br>
3 cloves garlic, minced</br>
1 pound kale, tough stems removed, leaves washed well and shredded (about 1 1/2 quarts)</br>
3 1/3 cups canned diced tomatoes with their juice (two 15-ounce cans)</br>
1 1/4 teaspoons salt</br>
1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper</br>
4 cups drained and rinsed canned cannellini beans (two 19-ounce cans)</br>
</br></br>
<b>Directions</b>
</br>
<b>Step 1</b></br>
In a Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderate heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking the meat up with a fork, until the it loses its pink color, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and then stir in the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to soften, about 3 minutes.

<b>Step 2</b>
Add the garlic and kale to the pan and cook, stirring, until the kale wilts, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the kale is tender, about 15 minutes.
</br></br>
<b>Step 3</b></br>
Stir the beans into the stew and cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. If you like, mash some of the beans with a fork to thicken the sauce.
</br></br>
<b>Notes</b></br>
Shred kale leaves as fine as possible when making quick soups and stews, so that each bite will include tender greens instead of a chewy mouthful.

<b>Suggested Pairing</b></br>
Since this dish has a strong Portuguese influence, why not pair it with a rustic red from Portugal? Try one of the many delicious examples from the Douro or Ribatejo regions for a lusty combination of food and drink.
